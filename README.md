# Simple-Note-System
I received a project for a college to carry out a simple grading system, to register grades, absences and display whether the student was approved or not. It performs login and password validation and then gives options to carry out actions. I would like you to make constructive criticism for better learning, remembering that it is a simple code that was requested by the teacher! Thanks :)
